 *         Description: Given a square array of integers A, we want the minimum
 *         sum of a falling path through A.
 * 
 *         A falling path starts at any element in the first row, and chooses
 *         one element from each row. The next row's choice must be in a column
 *         that is different from the previous row's column by at most one.
 *         </p>
